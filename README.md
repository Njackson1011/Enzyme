          Hello! Thank you for using Enzyme. You are currently running V3.0             
                                                                                        
     This is the document pertaining to your current installed Version of Enzyme.       
             Below you will find information on basic function of Enzyme.               
       Below you will also find information on the integration of DFBforEnzyme.         
    The .EXE is finally here! This gives an overview of what is included and functions.  
                                                                                        
                                                                                        
   #   ENZYME - ENZYME.EXE - DFBforEnzyme                                         
                                                                                        
     (1)  The Purpose                                                       
                     The files and programs contained within Enzyme          
                     enable the user to automate an array of tasks           
                     relative to the job-title of POS/ISV Tech I/II/III.     
                     NOTE: This exclusively  applies to the RM Support       
                     team at the current time.                               
                                                                                        
     (2)  The Goal                                                          
                     Enzyme's goal is to SAVE TIME by eliminating the        
                     need to perform many recurring manual tasks.            
                     This also ensures that the tasks are performed          
                     the same way by each tech, each time.                   
                     NOTE: This DOES NOT absolve the tech from the           
                     need to understand the functions and retain             
                     the knowledge of the same. These files are meant        
                     to be a time-saving aid, not a crutch.                  
                                                                                        
     (3)  What is Enzyme?                                                   
                     Enzyme is an EAP (Employee Assistance Package).         
                     Enzyme is a culmination of different PKGs and files.    
                     Most of Enzyme is written into Windows Batch files.     
                     These Batch files or (.BAT files) will allow,           
                     for example; automatic opening of your daily EXEs,      
                     webpages, VPN Connection, and more at the start of      
                     each shift with StartDailyTasks.BAT, which can          
                     also be put in your SHELL:STARTUP folder to...          
                     "autostart", hence the title of the main dir.           
                     This was originally the design of Enzyme entirely.      
                                                                                        
     (4)  What is Enzyme.EXE?                                               
                     Enzyme.EXE is the Employee Assistance Package GUI.      
                     Enzyme is a culmination of different PKGs and files.    
                     The executable GUI is meant to help you locate any      
                     batch files, .ZIPs, .EXEs and anything else included    
                     in the Enzyme Package. If there are any questions or    
                     errors that arise regarding the Enzyme.exe, please      
                     reach out on slack to resolve these. It is important    
                     to note that Enzyme.exe goes in your SHELL:STARTUP      
                     to start automatically in substitution of the           
                     StartDailyTasks.BAT.                                    
                                                                                        
     (5)  What is DFBforEnzyme?                                             
                     DFBforEnzyme is an Enzyme Integration to Google Drive.  
                     Our work Laptops do not allow for us to utilize the     
                     USB ports to transfer files or to import files that     
                     we need to use. DailyFileBackup allows for you to save  
                     your daily files into separate categories on the PC,    
                     then Enzyme will back the files up daily or on cue.     
                     With the help of an awesome testing team providing      
                     incredible feedback, suggestions, and rigid testing,    
                     Version 2.0 is full of goodies for getting the job      
                     done right the first time while substantially           
                     increasing efficiency. HAPPY AUTOMATING!

     (1)  autostart  c:\autostart - Referred to commonly as "Enzyme"        
                     Location of S4 programs and links for Startup.          
                     For Enzyme's base design, it was intented to help       
                     users start up the functions of their S4 Laptop.        
                     There are many programs that need to be open each       
                     shift and, per S4 security protocols, must be shut      
                     down each and every shift end. This arranges all        
                     necessary programs into your c:\autostart dir.          
                                                                                        
     (2)  Application  c:\autostart\Application                             
                     Location of ALL Enzyme.exe call files and related.      
                     Enzyme.EXE is the latest iterance of the Enzyme EAP.    
                     The purpose is to allow even a new user to easily       
                     navigate about the program. This will increase even     
                     further the time saved by using Enzyme.                 
                     NOTE: If you believe that something was overlooked      
                     or missed, please submit a ticket to errors and

                     Location of ALL Enzyme .BAT files/icons.                
                     Although Enzyme is helpful for automating tasks         
                     within S4 and RM, all files are found in the same       
                     "Home" location, c:\autostart\batchfilehome             
                     for the sake of consistency.                            
                     NOTE: Most of the .BAT file names will start with       
                     "RM" for those pertaining to RM, and S4 related         
                     files will start with "Start".

                     Location of NEW Enzyme .BAT files after UPDATE.         
                     If you are updating from any previous version of        
                     Enzyme, there is a separate file to do so.              
                     When you UPDATE your Enzyme, you will see a new         
                     dir c:\autostart\batchfileupdates.                      
                     NOTE: You will NOT see this dir when you install        
                     Enzyme for the first time.

                     Location of all RMWIN Template files for testing.       
                     Use this directory for testing your own issues, or      
                     configuring test ideas outside of a live system.        
                                                                                        
     (6)  RM Utilities  "c:\autostart\RM Utilities"                         
                     Location of .EXE and other helpful files for RM.        
                     There are many toolkits built into Enzyme for the       
                     RM program including local backups, printer             
                     utilities, full RMWIN templates, RM Upgrades, etc.      
                                                                                        
     (7)  UpdaterBackup  c:\autostart\UpdaterBackup                         
                     Location of NEW Enzyme .BAT files after UPDATE.         
                     If you are updating from any previous version of        
                     Enzyme, there is a separate file to do so.              
                     When you UPDATE your Enzyme, you will see a new         
                     dir c:\autostart\batchfileupdates.                      
                     NOTE: You will NOT see this dir when you install        
                     Enzyme for the first time.

     (1)  Enzyme S4 Files                                                   
                     These are files built to help aid in automation.        
                     Specifically, these are for your S4 Laptop and          
                     related programs. Cuts down on errors and assists       
                     in organization and startup/shutdown of your            
                     daily processes.                                        
                     These files will generally start with the prefix        
                     "start" for S4 Enzyme .BATs. These help you start       
                     your day, fix remote access program issues, and         
                     can help end your shift and backup your files to        
                     Google Drive, which allows for cloud backups.           
                                                                                        
     (2)  Enzyme RM Files                                                   
                     These are files built to help aid in automation.        
                     Specifically, these are for the RM Sites and            
                     related programs. Cuts down on time and assists         
                     in the prevention of everyday errors caused by          
                     hand during daily processes and maintenance.            
                     These files will generally start with the prefix        
                     "RM" for RM Enzyme .BATs. These help you bring INDEX    
                     and RMCLEAR tasks down to 30 seconds or less,           
                     allow for smooth transition to new servers, upgrades,   
                     software resets, and task-kills. Many of these will     
                     be used in tandem with bits out of the RM Utilities     
                     toolkit to allow for tasks to be performed quickly.     
                     For example; You have an RM site that needs an Index    
                     to resolve the problem at hand. Based on the drive      
                     on which RMWIN resides, use the relative RMIndexX.      
                     The Enzyme file will unshare the RMWIN, kill ALL        
                     relative .EXEs, and then all relative services will     
                     be stopped. The file will then automatically perform    
                     the required DEL .TMP, DEL .NTX, perform the index,   
                     perform a filegen of the RMWIN, reshare the RMWIN,      
                     then automatically restart all of the required .EXEs,   
                     services, and then restart the standalone UTG. This     
                     all happens within about 25 seconds, obviously          
                     substantially reducing the tech's time involved.
