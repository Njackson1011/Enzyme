  *                    ***********Enzyme is a culmination of different PKGs and files.    *
  *                    ***********Most of Enzyme is written into Windows Batch files.     *
  *                    ***********These Batch files or (.BAT files) will allow,           *
  *                    ***********for example; automatic opening of your daily EXEs,      *

  *                    ***********"autostart", hence the title of the main dir.           *
  *                    ***********This was originally the design of Enzyme entirely.      *

  *                    ***********on which RMWIN resides, use the relative RMIndexX.      *
  *                    ***********The Enzyme file will unshare the RMWIN, kill ALL        *
  *                    ***********relative .EXEs, and then all relative services will     *
  *                    ***********be stopped. The file will then automatically perform    *
  *                    ***********the required DEL *.TMP, DEL *.NTX, perform the index,   *
  *                    ***********perform a filegen of the RMWIN, reshare the RMWIN,      *
  *                    ***********then automatically restart all of the required .EXEs,   *
  *                    ***********services, and then restart the standalone UTG. This     *
  *                    ***********all happens within about 25 seconds, obviously          *
  *                    ***********substantially reducing the tech's time involved.        *
